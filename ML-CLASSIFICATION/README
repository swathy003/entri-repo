Classification

Objective of this assignment is to evaluate classification techniques in supervised learning in Machine Learning by applying them to real_world dataset. Here I've used Breast Cancer Dataset available in the sklearn library Tasks performed- loading dataset, data preprocessing, checking outliers, implement various classification algorithms,provided brief description of each algorithms, evaluate the models, and identified best model and worst model among them.
